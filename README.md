# Natural-Language-Processing
This repository includes the files used for the mye-053 Natural Language Processing course and it's Kaggle challenge.

In this challenge, I had to deal with the problem of predicting whether a research paper cites another research paper. I am given a citation network consisting of several thousands of research papers, along with their abstracts and their list of authors. The pipeline that is typically followed to deal with the problem is similar to the one applied in any classification problem; to use edge information to learn the parameters of a classifier and then to use the classifier to predict whether two nodes are linked by an edge or not.

Goal: The objective was to achieve the highest score possible with the submission.

Final private score was: 0.10553 log loss acquiring the 6th place in the private set with a solo team. In total 56 teams were qualified as successgul to the task at hand.

Utilized many libraries and especially CUDA.
